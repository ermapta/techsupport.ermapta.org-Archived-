# Get to know Teams

![photo of three old rotary pay phones][hero-image]

Teams is a newer application from Microsoft that is optimized for real-time, back-and-forth communication. Email is good for communicating large blocks of thought, but it lends itself to monologuing. Teams is better at capturing the dynamics of real human conversation.

You can think of Teams as having three primary modes of operation:

1. Impromptu conversations.
2. Scheduled conversations.
3. Handy access to Team resources.

Before we dive into installing and using Teams, take a couple minutes to watch this overview.

## Installing Teams

Like email, Teams has apps for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android. Teams will also work through just a Web browser. Unlike email, alternative clients don't exist in any meaningful way at this point, so the Teams app is really your only option to use Teams.

### Using Teams through a browser

You can use any device with a Web browser to access your email account. Simply go to <https://www.office.com> and click on Teams, or navigate directly to <https://teams.microsoft.com>.
