Technology has improved our lives in countless ways. From routine communication to medical advances, technology multiplies our ability to _do_.

In spite of these benefits, we often feel hostile towards technology for two reasons:

1. Technology is not human. It doesn't work the same way humans do, making it feel alien. It can feel cold and distant.
2. In many respects the pervasiveness of technology is so complete that it feels invasive. It's hard to find "time apart".

For these reasons, it can be hard to find the motivation to leverage technology - but please press the "I believe" button for just a moment and let's consider how technology can help our specific situation.

## Benefit #1: Protect data

The most obvious benefit we derive from technology is data protection. Data must be protected in at least three ways:

1. Lost information costs significant time and money.
2. Overexposed information creates organizational risk.
3. Untraceable information creates legal risk.

It is incredibly easy to lose information. Printed information by definition resides in one place and can be destroyed by water, fire, or children.

## Benefit #2: Equal participation

// remote participants, everyone with e-mail

## Other benefits

Information discovery
Information availability
Less physical burden
