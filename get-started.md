# Get started

![photo of person in starting blocks][hero-image]

Welcome to ERMA PTA! We are _so_ glad to have you join us.

Your time is incredibly valuable, and we want to help you protect it. One way we do that is through technology. We know what you're thinking - but please, give us a chance to explain.

## Technology helps

Technology helps us in two primary areas:

1. Protect data from accidental deletion or oversharing
2. Ensure that everyone is able to participate equally

For a much more thorough investigation of how technology helps, please see [Technology helps](technology-helps).

## The top 3 things you need to know

In the fullness of time there are many things we'd like to share with you, but for now let's focus on three areas.

[Set up email →](set-up-email)

Your email account is ready and waiting for you. You can use it on your mobile phone, your computer, or whatever device you prefer.

[Get to know Teams →](get-to-know-teams)

Teams is more of a real-time communication tool. It lets you IM, join calls, and collaborate with others in a very rich way.

[Save and share documents →](save-and-share-documents)

You can save documents in personal or shared locations. You can also share the documents with the group of people you specify.

## The laundry list of other links...
