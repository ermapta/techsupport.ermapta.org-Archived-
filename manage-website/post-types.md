# Post types

Post types are a critical aspect of managing content in WordPress. (Presumably, even the name "post types" hearkens back to WordPress's roots as a blogging platform.) Different post types have different behaviors and different capabilities.

In addition to the built-in post types, WordPress allows developers to add their own custom types. Plugins, such as the calendaring plugin EventON, have a tendency to add custom post types.

For <https://www.ermapta.org> it is best to be aware of five post types:

- [Pages](https://wordpress.org/support/article/post-types/#pages) are the primary mechanism we use to build content. Pages are extremely similar to posts apart from the fact that they tend to change/become outdated less frequently.
- [Posts](https://wordpress.org/support/article/post-types/#posts) are typically used for time-bound content. Posts are best for newsletters, fundraiser "pages", and other content that tends to be associated with a particular point in time.
- Events are a custom post type added by the [EventON plugin](https://www.myeventon.com/). Events are used for content that should appear in calendars.
- Forms are a custom post type added by the [Gravity Forms plugin](https://www.gravityforms.com/).
- Media (such as images or videos) have [attachments](https://wordpress.org/support/article/post-types/#attachments) that enable us to store alternate text and other metadata about the media.

In addition to these post types, nearly everything in WordPress is technically a post type including menus, event types, and more. Thinking about content in WordPress in this way helps make sense of things like permalinks/slugs, etc.
