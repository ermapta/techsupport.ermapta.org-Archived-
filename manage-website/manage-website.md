# Managing content on www.ermapta.org

Managing content on the website is not challenging, but it does require some learning up front. In this series, we will walk through:

1. [About WordPress and how to log into it][1]
2. [Backing up the website][2]
3. [WordPress post types and why they are relevant][3]
4. [Creating and modifying new pages][4]
5. [Managing events on the calendar][5]
6. [Modifying the menu][6]
7. [Modifying the look and feel of the website][7]

This content heavily links out to external documentation rather than reproducing all of the content here. If you find broken links or have other recommendations as to how to improve this content, please email [techsupport@ermapta.org](mailto:techsupport@ermapta.org?subject=Feedback%20re:%20manage%20website%20content).

Note: this series is only about managing the content on the website. This should be sufficient for most volunteers. For information on how the website is hosted, see <https://diy.ermapta.org>.
