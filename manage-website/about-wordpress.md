WordPress originated and is still best known as a blogging platform. This is good because it means that everything about WordPress is optimized around content creation. It's worth spending some time learning about blogging as this terminology is pervasive throughout WordPress: post types, permalinks, etc.

WordPress has an incredibly rich set of features available out of the box, but the single most important reason to choose WordPress is the prolific plugin community built around WordPress. Our WordPress installation uses plugins for backup, events, content editing, search engine optimization, even the theme itself is a plugin.

## Logging in to WordPress

You will need a username and password to log into WordPress. If you need credentials or have forgotten your credentials, please email
[techsupport@ermapta.org](mailto:techsupport@ermapta.org?subject=Need%20WordPress%20credentials).

You can log into Wordpress here: <https://www.ermapta.org/wp-admin>.

If this is your first time using WordPress, spend some time familiarizing yourself with the interface and layout. We do not use the Block Editor (this will make sense to you later), but the "First steps with WordPress" article linked below is highly recommended for getting familiar with the dashboard.

As you learn WordPress, it is okay to create posts and pages and to delete posts and pages you know are safe to delete. Please refrain from modifying the theme as this cannot easily be reverted.
