# Set up email

**Prerequisites:**

- You will need your username and password to set up your email. If you have not received your username and password, email [techsupport@ermapta.org][email-techsupport]
- You should have logged in at least once to <https://www.office.com>; doing this ensures that any required password reset is addressed before attempting to log into an email client.

## About your email address

Most staff members and volunteers have been configured with a user account and email address. You can receive or send email from a Web browser or an email client like Outlook or Gmail.

Your email address is intended primarily for official communication. It is completely reasonable to use the email address occasionally for personal purposes, but please do not make a habit of this.

## Accessing email from a browser

You can use any device with a Web browser to access your email account. Simply go to <https://www.office.com> and click on Outlook, or navigate directly to <https://outlook.office.com>.

## Accessing email from a mobile device

Microsoft Outlook is the recommended email client for two reasons:

1. Outlook is consistently one of the top two email apps in app stores and "best email app" metareviews (such as [this one by the Verge][verge-review]).
2. Microsoft develops the email service. When Microsoft also develops the email client, it is reasonable to expect the service and client to work well together.
